# Typing Test App

## AI Tools Used

To accelerate development and improve workflow, AI-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot were used throughout this project. These tools assisted with:

- Generating code snippets and boilerplate
- Refactoring and improving code quality
- Suggesting user stories, acceptance criteria, and tasks
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Providing instant documentation and best practices

Using AI tools helped speed up the coding process, reduce errors, and ensure a more robust and user-friendly application.
