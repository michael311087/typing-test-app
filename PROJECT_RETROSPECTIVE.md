## Lessons Learned üìö

### 1. GitHub Copilot Usage

**What Worked Well:**

- **Code Generation**: Excellent for implementing standard patterns (event listeners, DOM manipulation)
- **Documentation**: Helpful for generating comprehensive comments and user stories
- **Problem-Solving**: Effective for debugging and optimization suggestions
- **Accessibility**: Strong guidance on ARIA labels and semantic HTML

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **Context Awareness**: Sometimes needed multiple iterations to understand specific project context
- **Complex Logic**: Required manual refinement for intricate business logic
- **Testing**: Generated code needed thorough testing to ensure edge case handling

**Key Takeaways for Future Projects:**

- Use specific, detailed prompts with clear context
- Always test generated code thoroughly
- Leverage Copilot for boilerplate and standard patterns
- Combine Copilot suggestions with manual code review

### 2. Development Process

- **Incremental Development**: Building features progressively allowed for easier testing
- **User Story Driven**: Clear acceptance criteria guided development effectively
- **Version Control**: Regular commits provided safety net and clear progress tracking

### 3. Accessibility Considerations

- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML crucial for inclusivity
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Essential for users who cannot use mouse/touch
- **Color Contrast**: Visual feedback must work for users with visual impairments
